Recomendations:
This is a list of recommendations to make this project better 
(UI, UX, Performance, Security, Architecture, Bug fix, New Feature, ...etc )

// Please make your recommendations as clear as possible with only a few sentences 

1. attach monoDb to the application, the users are stored in the server side not file nor DB.

2. the Architecture of the BE and the FE.

3. fixing the issues the image and the change button functionality

4. the Design of the whole app.

5- added security using Jwt to move the user data btw FE and BE using the token of jwt-simple and encrypt the password using bcrypt



////
to make the application run open the mongoDB and add from the post man this object

{
	"username":"testingpew2w21",
	"password": "123123",
	"fullname": "test",
	"email": "123@123.123",
	"profilePicture": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511367461989-f85a21fda167?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=9017084ac611b76fb7506ccc54d854ac&w=1000&q=80"
}

more recommendation if i have time i will add services in the FE instead of having the Http request inside the controller, 
as i will send email from the BE an Email for the client after changing his/her password
i will put the styles on a separate file, as i will change the change password design to a popup maybe and 
i will put a validation to the forms.

i will change the node start to nodemon so i will not turn off on the server each time i want to make differance.

i will make the design better :)

i will put a generic toast for all the errors successfull and i will put loader as interceptor for all the Http requests.
